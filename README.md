## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS with BEMIT
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS Vanilla

### What I learned

I reinforced the concepts of flexbox and css grid.

### Continued development

The BEMIT convention is very useful because it allows us to write maintainable styles.
